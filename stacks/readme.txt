/*

In stacks we learnt the concept of monotonic stacks . 

In these problems we should decide first whether we want to decreasing or increasing monotonic stack 

increasing monotonic stacks means , The stack has increasing order of elements from the bottom of the stack .


For increasing monotonic stack , the largest element is at the top 

For decreasing monotonic stack , the smallest element is at the top , MinStack uses an auxilary decreasing monotonic stack
